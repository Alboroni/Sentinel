# Introduction

#### Lab technology
In this technical workshop, you will not need to access any IaaS or any other machines directly. Instead, you will use your own computer to access a preconfigured lab in Azure.

#### User accounts <br>
To access the azure lab, you will navigate to:(https://portal.azure.com)<br>
You will then logon with the following account:
**AdminXX@sentinellab.xyz***, where “XX” is the number you have been assigned at the start of class.<br>
For example, if I was assigned number 47, my username would be **user47@sentinellab.xyz**<br>
Username: **AdminXX@sentinellab.xyz**<br>
Password: **xxxxxxxx**
